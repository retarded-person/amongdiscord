**About Among Discord Bot**    
Among Discord Bot is a bot that has made Among Us into Discord! 
This project is open sourced and welcome to contributers. 

**How to run Among Bot**

If you dont have Python, please go to https://www.python.org/downloads/, and download the latest version. (3.9 as of this date.)
Once you do that, restart your computer after downloading.
After this, run Command Prompt, and type "pip install discord". This command will be used to install packages, and do this with the list below.
```
requests
datetime
discord
asyncio
random
time
logging
secrets
random
```
Note: Some may error because I'm too lazy to tell you what ones are already included with python instead of being 3rd party packages.

After this, download "Among Discord.py" if you havent already, and then run it.
